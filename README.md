Healthcare Appointments Dashboard Analysis
This Excel workbook provides a comprehensive analysis of healthcare appointment data across multiple hospitals. 
The dataset was first organized into a structured table containing patient demographics, doctor specializations, appointment types, consultation fees, waiting times, and hospital financial details such as expenses and profits. 
Pivot tables were then used to summarize and highlight critical insights, including hospital-wise revenue, appointment distributions, waiting time analysis, and specialization trends. 
Finally, an interactive dashboard was created to visually present these findings, allowing users to filter by hospital, location, or department. 
The combination of raw data, pivot-based summaries, and visualization tools offers a clear picture of hospital performance, patient flow, and profitability.
